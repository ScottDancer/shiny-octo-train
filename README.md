This will be my portfolio, not only to be used as a tool for hunting for the perfect job, but mainly a personal project that I can come back to and add pages that my not make sense, but will eventually tell a story that reflects the pieces of me that require this digital medium to from the pictures that create the words.  

The main focus of this build is project management and version control.
